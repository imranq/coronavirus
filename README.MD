## Analyzing the Coronavirus Genome

## Ideas 
- Deep learning to predict the next base pair
- Deep learning to detect which sequences will code proteins

## Technologies
- Javascript (to run analyses in a notebook and write visualizations)
- ObservableHQ
- MongoDB (to store genomic data to analyze)
- Python (to create deep learning models)

## Experiments
- Find where the proteins position themselves in the full sequence
- If the protein sequences overlap
- Where the protein starts and stops translation in the RNA sequence
- Composition of amino acids in proteins
