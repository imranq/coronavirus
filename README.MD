## Analyzing the Coronavirus Genome
![Alt text](public/covidimg.png?raw=true "Title")



## Technologies
- Javascript (to run analyses in a notebook and write visualizations)
- ObservableHQ
- MongoDB (to store genomic data to analyze)
- Python (to create deep learning models)

## Experiments
- Find where the proteins position themselves in the full sequence
- Locate positions of coding regions in RNA (generate visualization)
- If the protein sequences overlap
- Where the protein starts and stops translation in the RNA sequence
- Composition of amino acids in proteins
- Understanding the path of mutation and how the proteins change
- Deep learning to predict the next base pair in viral RNA
- Deep learning to detect which sequences in Viral RNA will code proteins
